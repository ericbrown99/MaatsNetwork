 Maats Network
 ======
 A 100% distributed, network of women/minority owned online stores made possible by combining Ethereum and IPFS.
 
 How does Maats Work?
 ------
Maats enables women and minority owners to create an online marketplace where they can sell their products. Owners come to the store and are verified as women or minority owners and are then given "Store Owner Access" to the Maats Network.
 
Every store on Maats is P2P, creating a frictionless experience for both customer's and store owners. The distributed and P2P nature of the network vastly reduces the operating costs for an online marketplace and therefore reduces the fees experienced by store owners [(Amazon takes over 15% of sales from owner's).](https://sellerengine.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-amazon/)
 
 
 Why "Maats"?
 ------
[Maat (or Ma'at)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maat) is the Egyptian goddess of balance, order, harmony, morality, and justice. She is most well known for the "Feather of Ma'at" which is weighed against the hearts of travelers in the underworld after their deaths. 
 
Maats Network strives to create equality and balance by supporting women and minority owners. Every purchase we make is a monetary vote for the values represented by the vendor. Vote for women and minority owners in our communities.
