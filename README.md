 MaatsNetwork
 ======
 A distributed, online network of women/minority owned stores utilizing Ethereum and IPFS.
 
 How does Maats Work?
 ------
 Maats enables women and minority owners to create an online marketplace where they can sell their products. Owners come to the store and are verified as women or minority owners and are then given "Store Owner Access" to the Maats Network. From there they get to create their own store. Every store on Maats is P2P, creating a frictionless experience for both customer's and store owners. The distributed and P2P nature of the networks vastly reduces the operating costs for an online marketplace and therefore reduces the fees experienced by store owners [(Amazon takes over 15% of sales from owner's).](https://sellerengine.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-amazon/)
